# G4_H263_Compression
## What is it?
This repository contains the software and hardware necessary to create a media compression system using the H.263 algorithm. At the current state, the system only supports image compression but can be extended to video with image compensation. We hope that this project will serve as a basis for future media compression based designs

## Acknowledgements
We would like to thank Xilinx for providing open source 3rd party IP cores (TEMAC, UARTLite, AXIS FIFO, etc.) which we have utilized in our design. We also like to thank Professor Chow for supplying the class with Xilinx FPGAs over the FPGA-net and the TAs for their continued support on Piazza.
